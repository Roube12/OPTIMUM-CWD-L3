        <p><b>Traditional</b> teaching
            The back-to-basics traditional education method, also known as conventional education, is still widely used
            in schools. The old-fashioned way of teaching was all about recitation, for example students would sit in
            silence, while one student after another would take it in turns to recite the lesson, until each one had
            been called upon. The teacher would listen to each student’s recitation, and they were expected to study and
            memorise the assignments. At the end of the module a written test or oral examination would be conducted;
            this process was called an Assignment Study Recitation Test.

        </p>
        <p>The way in which <b>traditional methods</b> were taught ensured that students were rewarded for their
            efforts, used
            class periods efficiently and exercised clear rules to manage students’ behaviour. They were based on
            established customs that had been used successfully in schools over many years. The teachers communicated
            the knowledge and enforced standards of behaviour.</p>

        <p> Education reforms mean that learning is taught from a completely different angle. <b>Progressive
                educational</b> practices focus more on the individual student's needs rather than assuming all students
            are at
            the same level of understanding. The modern way of teaching is more activity based, using questioning,
            explaining, demonstration and collaboration techniques.

        </p>
        <p>One modern method is <i><b>spaced learning</b>, this is when students are encouraged to
                quickly switch through activities, for example; providing 10 minutes of knowledge on a subject with a
                PowerPoint presentation and then having 15 minutes of sport. The aim of spaced learning is to achieve
                better
                grades, and it works! It is claimed that this is a more effective than teaching students by traditional
                methods for four hours, thus helping the brain cells to create connections that they need to remember
                knowledge. It also helps people relax.

                Sonia Jackson who wrote an interesting blog post about modern teaching methods for Getting Smart states:
                “The traditional “chalk and talk” method of teaching that’s persisted for hundreds of years is now
                acquiring
                inferior results when compared with the more modern and revolutionary teaching methods that are
                available
                for use in schools today. Greater student interaction is encouraged, the boundaries of authority are
                being
                broken down, and a focus on enjoyment over grades is emphasised.”</p>
